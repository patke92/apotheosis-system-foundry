{"_id":"5nTDrRoxCFkmMDk0","name":"Neurocite","type":"race","img":"icons/svg/item-bag.svg","data":{"description":"<p>Neurocites are small and insect-like. They can burrow through the base of the skull of vertebrate creatures and control their minds. Neurocites generally pick a host for life, often burrowing into the skull of infants and developing with them. The burrowing process is painful for the neurocite&rsquo;s soon-to-be host so neurocites generally target creatures which are helpless, restrained, or subdued. Once a neurocite has possessed a host, it gains not only full motor control of the creature&rsquo;s body but also the ability to feel and interpret all of its sensory input. Neurocites are so closely linked with their hosts, that pain for the host is indistinguishable from real pain for the neurocite. The same goes for other sensory information. Neurocites can tell when a creature is being controlled by another neurocite. When two neurocites find each other, they will often temporarily paralyze their hosts and burrow out in order to lay and fertilize eggs. This can be done by any two neurocites, since all have both male and female reproductive organs. Neurocites are generally unfamiliar with love and other humanoid emotions, though they do their best to emulate them and fit in to avoid being discovered. Neurocites are hated by essentially all humanoids, and, if someone is found to be a host to a neurocite, a stake is driven through the skull to kill both neurocite and host.</p>\n<p><strong>As a Neurocite you will gain the following initial attribute distribution:&nbsp;</strong><br />Strength 0, Dexterity 0, Constitution 0, Intelligence 2, Charisma 2</p>\n<p>As a neurocite you may choose one attribute from Strength, Dexterity, or Constitution to add 1 too, this will represent the initial attributes of your host, assuming you start with one. <br />If you choose to start without a host, ignore this and take the Strength, Dexterity, and Constitution attributes of a host once you find one.</p>\n<p><strong>You also gain the following species traits:&nbsp;</strong></p>\n<p><strong>Aging</strong>: There is no known limit to the lifespan of a neurocite, though they cannot survive for more than a month without a host. A neurocite&rsquo;s host lives a lifespan appropriate to the species. Despite a long lifespan, neurocites live only a few days on average due to high mortality rates in their eggs and early development. Once hatched, a neurocite reaches matuirity within a week.</p>\n<p><strong>Alignment</strong>: Neurocites tend toward neutral alignments since they rarely respect the laws of humanoids and are primarily motivated by self-preservation.</p>\n<p><strong>Size</strong>: Neurocites are between 1 and 2 inches in size, though the size of their host&rsquo;s can vary. Neurocites are of the miniature size class.</p>\n<p><strong>Speed</strong>: Without a host, a neurocite&rsquo;s speed is 1 foot walking or 5 feet flying.</p>\n<p><strong>Physical Disconnect</strong>: A host body will never respond quite as quickly to a neurocite as it would its own brain. A host being controlled by a neurocite requires twice as many attribute progression points for Dexterity attribute increases. (20 times the attribute score instead of 10 and with a minimum of 20).</p>\n<p><strong>Host Dependent</strong>: Though a neurocite&rsquo;s host body may improve physically over time, the neurocite will not. As a neurocite your Strength, Dexterity, and Constitution scores cannot be increased past 0. However, while in a host body, a neurocite can use the host&rsquo;s Strength, Dexterity, and Constitution attributes any time those attributes are referenced. However, a neurocite does not inherit the abilities of its host. Abilities are permanent and transfer with a neurocite between hosts. Abilities cannot be used or gained unless the neurocite (or its host) meet the prerequisites.</p>\n<p><strong>Conquered Mind</strong>: Anytime a neurocite&rsquo;s Intelligence or Charisma is referenced, they must use their own Intelligence or Charisma and not that of their host body.</p>\n<p><strong>Body of The Host</strong>: Neurocite&rsquo;s gain the species traits of whatever body they control. Additionally, a host body&rsquo;s Strength, Dexterity, and Constitution attributes can all increase using attribute progression points while the body is being controlled by a neurocite.</p>\n<p><strong>Disembark</strong>: As a neurocite you can release an agent into your host body that will paralyze it for 1 hour. After the hour is over, the body will reanimate under the control of the host&rsquo;s brain unless you have reassert control by re-entering the brain.</p>\n<p><strong>Dominate Host</strong>: While outside of a host body a neurocite can attempt to claim one. To do this a neurocite must position itself at the base of a creature's skull and spend at least 1 minute burrowing into the brain. This action is painful for the targeted creature and will alert them to the neurocite&rsquo;s presence if they were not already aware. The process of burrowing into and dominating a host&rsquo;s brain isn&rsquo;t risk free, the process wounds the host for 1D10 piercing damage. If this damage kills the host, the neurocite cannot use the host body and must find a new one. Creatures targeted by this ability must be of at least a small size class and no larger than the large size class. Additionally, the targeted creature must have a working brain and nervous system.</p>\n<p><strong>Crowded Mind</strong>: Neurocite&rsquo;s minds cannot be read while they inhibit a host body. Attempts to read one&rsquo;s mind will either yield unintelligible murmurs or the thoughts of the host body&rsquo;s brain at the GM&rsquo;s discretion.</p>\n<p><strong>Language</strong>: Neurocites know Phrenic and can use it to communicate psychically to any creature within 10 feet of them, as long as they share at least 1 known language with the creature. Additionally, neurocites can speak in the primary language of their host body as long as they are occupying it.</p>","attributeModifiers":{"str":{"value":0,"saveMod":0},"dex":{"value":0,"saveMod":0},"con":{"value":0,"saveMod":0},"int":{"value":2,"saveMod":0},"cha":{"value":2,"saveMod":0},"luck":{"value":0,"saveMod":0}},"checkModifiers":{"athletics":{"attribute":"str","value":0},"grappling":{"attribute":"str","value":0},"acrobatics":{"attribute":"dex","value":0},"reflex":{"attribute":"dex","value":0},"stealth":{"attribute":"dex","value":0},"awareness":{"attribute":"con","value":0},"endurance":{"attribute":"con","value":0},"survival":{"attribute":"con","value":0},"arcaneKnowledge":{"attribute":"int","value":0},"comprehension":{"attribute":"int","value":0},"history":{"attribute":"int","value":0},"investigation":{"attribute":"int","value":0},"medicine":{"attribute":"int","value":0},"nature":{"attribute":"int","value":0},"religion":{"attribute":"int","value":0},"animalHandling":{"attribute":"cha","value":0},"deception":{"attribute":"cha","value":0},"distraction":{"attribute":"cha","value":0},"insight":{"attribute":"cha","value":0},"intimidation":{"attribute":"cha","value":0},"persuasion":{"attribute":"cha","value":0},"sleightOfHand":{"attribute":"cha","value":0}},"movementSpeed":5,"encumbranceSpeedDecreaseThreshold":5,"size":"miniature"},"effects":[],"folder":null,"sort":0,"permission":{"default":0,"qHyhEMzyJhK7VsDm":3},"flags":{}}

{"_id":"rQUH3he2rbcxKnUv","name":"Antherian","type":"race","img":"icons/svg/item-bag.svg","data":{"description":"<p>Antherians are the descendant offspring of humans and nature spirits such as nymphs and dryads. Antherians have humanoid posture and structure but with animal-like characteristics. Antherians generally live in small, often nomadic, tribes. They are frequently looked down on by the other species as primitive and brutish because of their appearance and preference for speaking Therianthropic. Therianthropic is an ancient language with some magical properties, allowing those who know it to better communicate with animals and more easily invoke nature magic. Some cultures kill antherians when found or are otherwise hostile toward them, confusing them for the unrelated and far more aggressive, lycanthropes such as werewolves. Depending on their lineage, antherians can appear in a variety of ways and manifest various animallike characteristics.</p>\n<p><strong>As an antherian you will gain the following initial attribute distribution:</strong><br />Strength 0, Dexterity 1, Constitution 1, Intelligence 1, Charisma 0</p>\n<p><strong>Antherians come in many forms, each with their own characteristics.
